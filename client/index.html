<p>
  Many factors affect how much you are paid, including the sector you work in, your age and how long you have been in a job.
</p>
<p>
  But thanks to a law forcing UK employers to publish details of the differences between male and female pay and bonuses for the first time, there is a new spotlight on how gender affects pay.
</p>
<p>
  The average woman working full-time in the UK earns 9.4 per cent less than a man per hour. With part-timers included, the gap is 18.1 per cent.

  <h2 id="methodology"> Our data and methodology </h2>
  <div class="o-expander__content">
    <h3 class="methodology-heading">What data did we use?</h3>
    <p class="methodology-para">
      To calculate the gender pay gap as it applies to individuals we looked at data from the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2016provisionalresults">
      Office for National Statistics' annual survey of hours and earnings.
      </a>. We extracted figures on how much men and women in full-time work earn, depending on their age groups and the profession they belong to, a classification that ONS statisticians call "SOC2010".
    </p>

    <h3 class="methodology-heading">How detailed is it?</h3>
    <p class="methodology-para">
      We drilled into the data even further by analysing different decile groups. The ONS splits the individuals they surveyed within each gender, role and age group into ten equal groups.
    </p>
    <p class="methodology-para">
      We included this data on deciles so that if we were looking, for example, at the average gross annual salary of a nurse in her 30s, we would be able to identify which decile she belonged to and compare her salary to that of a male nurse in his 30s belonging
      to the same decile.
    </p>

    <h3 class="methodology-heading">How does the calculator work?</h3>
    <p class="methodology-para">
      When someone enters their gender, age and salary our calculator identifies which decile group they belong to in their profession. If the data for one decile is not available, we calculate the difference in salaries in the closest earning group for which
      there are data. So if data for the top 10 per cent are not available, we would move to the ninth decile or further down depending on availabilty of data. In some cases, only the median is available, so we use that. This is in order to be as precise
      as possible, and to reflect the fact that people in the same job and age group may be paid differently based on their experience and skill level.
    </p>

    <h3 class="methodology-heading">Why did we just use data on full-time workers?</h3>
    <p class="methodology-para">
      A lot more women than men work in part-time jobs and we were concerned this would skew the data and make the gender pay gap appear wider.
    </p>

    <h3 class="methodology-heading">What about tax?</h3>
    <p class="methodology-para">
      We calculate tax and national insurance payments based on the formulas in this <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uk-tax-calculator" target="_blank">open source UK tax calculator</a>. This subtracts tax and national insurance based on a given
      salary. Student loan payments and pension contributions are not included.
    </p>
